# La Toscana Website
A website that goes by the name of La Toscana that I made for my Web Development 1 assignment in first year.

## Assignment Introduction

There were various of different clients with different tasks, I chose the client that wanted the La Toscana website built.

La Toscana -- a new Italian Restaurant & Pizzaria offering wonderfully delicious food and extravagant prices in city center.

I Coded my web-site using HTML5. I included tables, layer(div), forms, anchors and hyperlinks in my website. I also used CSS and JavaScript in my website too.
